Instructions for using TouchDesigner effects (actual effects may differ from expectations, please refer to the actual effects)

## Dream Catcher Holo
### 1.Introduction
In our projects, TouchDesigner plays a key role in creating immersive interactive experiences. The product workflow begins by detecting whether a person has fallen asleep, at which point a drone flies to collect sleep data. At the same time, the system collects large amounts of data. When the user wakes up and the memory is still fresh, the user describes the dream to the machine through language or other means.

Based on the keywords described in the dream, TouchDesigner will generate different interactive effects, taking advantage of the product's holographic projection and internal computing power.

### 2.Installation guide
Make sure your computer has the latest version of TouchDesigner installed.
Install a camera (either built-in or external).
Connect a projector for display.
Instructions for use
Open the TouchDesigner file, launch the built-in or connected camera, and make sure it's working properly.

Connect to the projector and set it up as an extended display in Windows 10 (or depending on your operating system).
